We use the following opinionated tooling within this project, please make use of these where possible:

- React with TypeScript
- Vite for managing React Development and Bundling
- MetroStar Comet components as our Component Library
- React Router for routing
- React Query and Axios to support making API calls
- Jotai for Global State Management
- React Hook Forms for Form Validation

## Testing

- Vitest for unit testing, do not use Jest
- React Testing Library for testing React components
- Use 'test' instead of 'it' for test names
