# Welcome to the Comet Starter App!

The goal of this project is to provide a React with TypeScript starter application, which comes pre-configured with the USWDS-based [Comet Component Library](https://github.com/MetroStar/comet) as well as other tools to accelerate development. Some of these tools are as follows:

- Tooling: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Platform: [React](https://react.dev/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Component Library: [Comet Component Library](https://github.com/MetroStar/comet)
- Data Visualization: [Victory Charts](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/)
- Global State Management: [Jotai](https://jotai.org/)
- Asynchronous State Management: [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/)
- API Support: [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- Form Validation: [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- Unit Testing: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- Code Analysis: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- Code Formatting: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- End-to-End (E2E) Testing: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

## Running the Project Locally

1. To install dependencies, run the following:

```sh
npm install
```

2. To install the [Comet CLI](https://github.com/MetroStar/comet/tree/main/packages/comet-cli#example-commands), run the following (optional):

```sh
npm install -g @metrostar/comet-cli
```

3. Install Recommended VS Code Extensions (optional)

4. To run locally with SSO, add a file called `.env.local` to the `comet-starter` directory. Copy and paste the template below and replace the placeholder values with your own (optional):

```
VITE_SSO_AUTHORITY=[SOME_KEYCLOAK_REALM_URL] # Ex: http://localhost:8088/realms/dev
VITE_SSO_CLIENT_ID=[SOME_CLIENT_ID] # Ex: dev-client
```

5. To start the app, run the following:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Running Unit Tests

To make sure your changes do not break any unit tests, run the following:

```sh
npm run test
```

Ensure to review the coverage directory for code coverage details.

```sh
npm run test:coverage
```

## Running Code Quality Checks

To make sure your changes adhere to additional code quality standards, run the following:

```sh
npm run lint
npm run format
```

You can also see the `.vscode/settings.json` file to find how to enable auto-formatting on save.

## Running End-to-End (E2E) Tests

Note: running E2E tests requires a deployed or running app.

1. To run against a deployed app, add the following to your .env.local (optional):

```
VITE_BASE_URL=SOME_URL # Ex: 'https://metrostar.github.io/comet-starter/'
```

2. To install playwright dependencies, run the following (only required the first time):

```sh
npx playwright install
```

3. To run e2e tests, run the following:

```sh
npm run e2e
```

## Running Accessibility (a11y) Tests

Note: running accessibility tests requires a deployed or running app.

1. To run against a deployed app, add the following to your .env.local (optional):

```
VITE_BASE_URL=SOME_URL # Ex: 'https://metrostar.github.io/comet-starter/'
```

2. To run accessibility tests, run the following:

```sh
npm run a11y
```
